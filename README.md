### Gradient Hatch

Built on top of the Hatch Outline filter

With this plugin you can create gradient hatched outlines.

#### Known Problems

- Because it uses the initial Hatch Outline filter, it has some trouble hatching letters with counters where the innermost open area is treated as a solid shape.
Hopefully this will be fixed in the future.
- Localisation is missing, this is because the [initially auto-translated strings](https://github.com/tcarisland/tclang/blob/main/src/main/resources/projects/advancedhatch/advancedhatch_translated.yml) were more confusing than helpful.
