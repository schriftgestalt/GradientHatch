### Advanced Hatch

Built on top of the Hatch Outline filter

With this plugin you can create gradient hatched outlines.

#### Known Problems

Because it uses the initial Hatch Outline filter, it has some trouble hatching letters with counters where the innermost open area is treated as a solid shape.
Might be fixed in the future.
