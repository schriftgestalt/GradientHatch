### Advanced Hatch

Built on top of the Hatch Outline filter

With this plugin you can create gradient hatched outlines.

#### Known Problems

- Because it uses the initial Hatch Outline filter, it has some trouble hatching letters with counters where the innermost open area is treated as a solid shape.
Hopefully this will be fixed in the future.
- The localised labels are auto-translated, which means they probably don't have the best translations for languages other than English, feel free to make suggestions for better label names in a particular language if you know the language.
